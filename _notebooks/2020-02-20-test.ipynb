    "> - Random forest is a kind of universal machine learning technique\n",
    "- It can be used for both regression (target is a continuous variable) or classification (target is a categorical variable) problems\n",
    "- It also works with columns of any kinds, like pixel values, zip codes, revenue, etc.\n",
    "- In general, random forest does not overfit (it’s very easy to stop it from overfitting)\n",
    "- You do not need a separate validation set in general. It can tell you how well it generalizes even if you only have one dataset\n",
    "- It has few (if any) statistical assumptions (it doesn’t assume that data is normally distributed, data is linear, or that you need to specify the interactions)\n",
    "- Requires very few feature engineering tactics, so it’s a great place to start. For many different types of situations, you do not have to take the log of the data or multiply interactions together\n",
    "- Most machine learning models (including random forest) cannot directly use categorical columns.\n",
