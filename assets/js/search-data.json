            "title": "Introducing fastpages",
            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides has for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . If you want to completely hide cells (not just collapse them), read these instructions. . Interactive Charts With Altair . Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive! . We leave this below cell unhidden so you can enjoy a preview of syntax highlighting in fastpages, which uses the Dracula theme. . # select a point for which to provide details-on-demand label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=700, height=400 ) . Data Tables . You can display tables per the usual way in your blog: . movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; df = pd.read_json(movies) # display table with pandas df[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Worldwide_Gross&#39;, &#39;Production_Budget&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;]].head() . Title Worldwide_Gross Production_Budget IMDB_Rating . 0 The Land Girls | 146083.0 | 8000000.0 | 6.1 | . 1 First Love, Last Rites | 10876.0 | 300000.0 | 6.9 | . 2 I Married a Strange Person | 203134.0 | 250000.0 | 6.8 | . 3 Let&#39;s Talk About Sex | 373615.0 | 300000.0 | NaN | . 4 Slam | 1087521.0 | 1000000.0 | 3.4 | . Other Feautures . Images w/Captions . You can include markdown images with captions like this: . ![](https://www.fast.ai/images/fastai_paper/show_batch.png &quot;Credit: https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/&quot;) . .

Note: A doc link to an example website: fast.ai should also work fine. . More Examples . This tutorial contains more examples of what you can do with notebooks. . How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . We will discuss how GitHub Actions work in a follow up blog post. . Resources &amp; Next Steps . We highly encourage you to start blogging with fastpages! Some resources that may be helpful: . fastpages repo - this is where you can go to create your own fastpages blog! | Fastai forums - nbdev &amp; blogging category. You can ask questions about fastpages here, as well as suggest new features. | nbdev: this project powers the conversion of Jupyter notebooks to blog posts. | .

            "title": "A Greek tragedy in the 20th century",
            "content": "Score: 4/5 . Last year I read the Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, which halfway through felt like an ice shower being on a circular loop. By the time I reached the end of the book, I felt so horrible for all the children and the “gift” we are so proudly giving, the wrecked planet. What an inheritance! I bet none of them would love us more for it. Then I picked up this book, Losing Earth: The Decade We Could Have Stopped Climate Change, which judging by the title will provide for yet another icy shower. Long story short, it did not disappoint. . Starting strong with the first sentence, “Nearly everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979.”, meaning we have been incompetent for the past 40 years! I say incompetent since we had all the information needed to start acting on it. Sadly, some are still applauding themselves. . This science history book reads like a thriller but feels like a Greek tragedy, with the plot, riding the structural wave with twists and turns showcasing the battle between the good and the evil. If only we didn’t know how this scenario would end. . Losing Earth provides a detailed historical account of the many events, House and Senate hearings, reports, conferences, that shaped the climate “debate” starting in 1979 and leading up to the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. We follow the journey of the lead character, an environmental lobbyist, Rafe Promenance, and a NASA scientist Jim Hansen, who each in their way battle with the political circle, oil&amp;gas industry, and the general public. Their primary goal is the acknowledgment of the scientific results on the greenhouse effects and the first official actions of a solution. This battle, at times, does not end well for them, as you could imagine. . What to do? It is discouraging to think that with all the information, technology, and advancements we pride ourselves, we are still mostly blind and unable to move past the crawling stage of human development and start walking into a better future. . To end the review, I will borrow a quote from dr. Tyson’s latest book The Letters from An Astrophysicist on the question “What if you are President” to which he answers: . “One objective reality is that our government doesn’t work, not because we have dysfunctional politicians, but because we have dysfunctional voters. As a scientist and educator, my goal, then, is not to become President and lead a dysfunctional electorate, but to enlighten the electorate so they might choose the right leaders in the first place.” .

            "title": "Science diplomacy, a new field?",
            "content": "Score: 4/5 . A new book by Neil deGrasse Tyson always lures me back into the bookstore, and this one is no exception. Letters from an Astrophysicist provides a structurally different book. Here we are privileged to get a view of multidimensional opinions and questions swirling around in our society, paired together with answers which embrace science diplomacy at its best. And all of this in an almost forgotten practice of correspondence of letter writing. . The correspondence is a presentation of numerous letters, received over the years, divided into four sections: . Ethos (The characteristic spirit of culture, manifested in its beliefs and aspirations), | Cosmos (The Universe seen as a well-ordered whole), | Pathos (A plaintive appeal to emotions that already reside within us), and | Kairos (A propitious moment for decision or action). | . These are then further segmented into topics such as hope, IQ, parenting, science denial, school days, UFOs, etc. All of the questions are unique in their way and given their subject matter. For example, from the segment science denial, we have “Where is the proof?”, in which the word proof relates to evolution and the age of the physical universe. The answer dr. Tyson gave here is very to the point, providing enough scientific (non-controversial) information to move from denial to an actual question, which hopefully further leads to research and widening personal information bucket. “Lego” blocks inching upwards. . My biggest takeaway from the book is the nature, structure, and the appropriateness of responses. There are times we can find ourselves in situations where our audience does not share the same opinion about the topic at hand, which can stir emotions on either side. With the advent of social media, these experiences increase manifold. Dr. Tyson enriches the reader with many diverse angles of human thinking and provides a measured, lucid, and leveled response, proving yet again to be a great teacher, not just of science, but of how to be human. This book will provide you with the numerous ways for communication exchanges to continue and end amicably, regardless of which belief, knowledge, or point of view you or your audience is coming from. . The prologue and epilogue provide yet another, even more personal, take on what it takes to succeed in life. The prologue is like a “memoir” of dr. Tyson’s life path, while the epilogue is a “eulogy” to his father. Both are genuinely fascinating and emotional. To “translate” the words, I would say that I see it as a track race with hurdles in which one doesn’t turn back, having regrets or pointing the blame for experiences, because the next hurdle is coming. Just look straight and keep moving. . The book was fun to read, refreshing, entertaining, while not requiring previous knowledge in astrophysics. There are many excellent and thoughtful quotes one can get from this book, but for me, this one is the strongest because it supersedes the other ones. . “Failure is common to us all. But ambitious people use their failures as lessons to heed, as they push forward toward their goals. Don’t fear change. Don’t fear failure. The only thing to fear is loss of ambition.” . References . Tyson, N. D. G. (2019). Letters from an astrophysicist. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. . Quotes . “One objective reality is that our government doesn’t work, not because we have dysfunctional voters. As a scientist and educator, my goal, then, is not to become President and lead a dysfunctional electorate, but to enlighten the electorate so they might choose the right leaders in the first place.” .",
