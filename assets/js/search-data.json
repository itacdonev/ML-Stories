            "content": "Score: 4/5 . Last year I read the Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, which halfway through felt like an ice shower being on a circular loop. By the time I reached the end of the book, I felt so horrible for all the children and the “gift” we are so proudly giving, the wrecked planet. What an inheritance! I bet none of them would love us more for it. Then I picked up this book, Losing Earth: The Decade We Could Have Stopped Climate Change, which judging by the title will provide for yet another icy shower. Long story short, it did not disappoint. . Starting strong with the first sentence, “Nearly everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979.”, meaning we have been incompetent for the past 40 years! I say incompetent since we had all the information needed to start acting on it. Sadly, some are still applauding themselves. . This science history book reads like a thriller but feels like a Greek tragedy, with the plot, riding the structural wave with twists and turns showcasing the battle between the good and the evil. If only we didn’t know how this scenario would end. . Losing Earth provides a detailed historical account of the many events, House and Senate hearings, reports, conferences, that shaped the climate “debate” starting in 1979 and leading up to the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. We follow the journey of the lead character, an environmental lobbyist, Rafe Promenance, and a NASA scientist Jim Hansen, who each in their way battle with the political circle, oil&amp;gas industry, and the general public. Their primary goal is the acknowledgment of the scientific results on the greenhouse effects and the first official actions of a solution. This battle, at times, does not end well for them, as you could imagine. . What to do? It is discouraging to think that with all the information, technology, and advancements we pride ourselves, we are still mostly blind and unable to move past the crawling stage of human development and start walking into a better future. . To end the review, I will borrow a quote from dr. Tyson’s latest book The Letters from An Astrophysicist on the question “What if you are President” to which he answers: . “One objective reality is that our government doesn’t work, not because we have dysfunctional politicians, but because we have dysfunctional voters. As a scientist and educator, my goal, then, is not to become President and lead a dysfunctional electorate, but to enlighten the electorate so they might choose the right leaders in the first place.” .

            "title": "Science diplomacy, a new field?",
            "content": "Score: 4/5 . A new book by Neil deGrasse Tyson always lures me back into the bookstore, and this one is no exception. Letters from an Astrophysicist provides a structurally different book. Here we are privileged to get a view of multidimensional opinions and questions swirling around in our society, paired together with answers which embrace science diplomacy at its best. And all of this in an almost forgotten practice of correspondence of letter writing. . The correspondence is a presentation of numerous letters, received over the years, divided into four sections: . Ethos (The characteristic spirit of culture, manifested in its beliefs and aspirations), | Cosmos (The Universe seen as a well-ordered whole), | Pathos (A plaintive appeal to emotions that already reside within us), and | Kairos (A propitious moment for decision or action). | . These are then further segmented into topics such as hope, IQ, parenting, science denial, school days, UFOs, etc. All of the questions are unique in their way and given their subject matter. For example, from the segment science denial, we have “Where is the proof?”, in which the word proof relates to evolution and the age of the physical universe. The answer dr. Tyson gave here is very to the point, providing enough scientific (non-controversial) information to move from denial to an actual question, which hopefully further leads to research and widening personal information bucket. “Lego” blocks inching upwards. . My biggest takeaway from the book is the nature, structure, and the appropriateness of responses. There are times we can find ourselves in situations where our audience does not share the same opinion about the topic at hand, which can stir emotions on either side. With the advent of social media, these experiences increase manifold. Dr. Tyson enriches the reader with many diverse angles of human thinking and provides a measured, lucid, and leveled response, proving yet again to be a great teacher, not just of science, but of how to be human. This book will provide you with the numerous ways for communication exchanges to continue and end amicably, regardless of which belief, knowledge, or point of view you or your audience is coming from. . The prologue and epilogue provide yet another, even more personal, take on what it takes to succeed in life. The prologue is like a “memoir” of dr. Tyson’s life path, while the epilogue is a “eulogy” to his father. Both are genuinely fascinating and emotional. To “translate” the words, I would say that I see it as a track race with hurdles in which one doesn’t turn back, having regrets or pointing the blame for experiences, because the next hurdle is coming. Just look straight and keep moving. . The book was fun to read, refreshing, entertaining, while not requiring previous knowledge in astrophysics. There are many excellent and thoughtful quotes one can get from this book, but for me, this one is the strongest because it supersedes the other ones. . “Failure is common to us all. But ambitious people use their failures as lessons to heed, as they push forward toward their goals. Don’t fear change. Don’t fear failure. The only thing to fear is loss of ambition.” . Quotes . “One objective reality is that our government doesn’t work, not because we have dysfunctional voters. As a scientist and educator, my goal, then, is not to become President and lead a dysfunctional electorate, but to enlighten the electorate so they might choose the right leaders in the first place.” .

            "title": "A pinch of AI?",
            "content": "Score: 4/5 . The research in AI is growing without the rules or regulations, but with the common goal of achieving the general purpose AI. Do you notice the problem? With many notable achievements in the field, the AI revolution started with many jumping on the high-speed train. It seems as if any project somehow sounds and looks better if we add a pinch of AI to it. But does it? Are we driving blindly? Most likely. Some researchers already ceased their research efforts because the results and methods are being used in a way that is not beneficial to society. If you are one of the passengers on the high-speed train, please take the blindfold off and read this book to be able to act accordingly before your research goes a step too far. . Human Compatible is an honest, eye-opening account of the AI potential and the right way forward, its current shortcomings, and, if we choose the wrong path, our doom. The question is, how do we create an AI system so that we don’t need to consider the control issue, or lack of control for that matter, in every scenario of AI application? How do we overcome the problem of the AI system being willing to be shut down? . Russell takes us back in history to revisit the routes taken in human learning, decision making, and actions taken, as well as how we transferred the learning process onto a machine. As we know, many applications have the AI label from speech recognition, vision systems, translation, etc. and many more will come. But our overall mission is to develop the so-called general-purpose AI, which by Russell is “…a method that is applicable across all problem types and works effectively for large and difficult instances while making very few assumptions.” Sounds good, but as he notes in many instances across the book, many precautions need to be taken along the way. For example, how to align AI and human objectives, how to incorporate our uncertainties and irrational decisions? In short, we need algorithms that would show that the end goal is beneficial to humans. . If you want a fresh perspective on what constitutes AI, how to adjust our current practices, or the standard model for an AI, more in line with our uncertain preferences and objectives; then, this book will help you in this quest. Stuart Russell, one of the most prominent persons in the AI world, embarks on the mission to not only examine how and why the AI could go wrong but most importantly what to consider and how to proceed so that we, the humanity, don’t end up on the flimsy and half-broken tree branch of existence. . In many science disciplines, we battle with the question of how our reality will cease to exist. In astronomy, it is in the way of the Sun engulfing the Earth, in biology, it might be some deadly virus that spreads quickly and efficiently, in environmental science it is the climate change, in computer science, it is the AI. Due to the laws of physics, we can’t much argue with the Sun engulfing the Earth scenario, but with the AI, we can change the dooms outcome since we are the ones creating it and its laws. In Human Compatible, Russell provides an eye-opening perspective on how to mitigate the AI risk and achieve the human compatible status. The secret lies in how we define the objectives of an AI system and its ability or understanding of the need to be switched off at any time that the human deems essential. . I enjoyed the book, which makes for a smooth and light read due to the elegant, flowy, and transparent presentation of ideas and concepts despite the complexity of the topic. The voice is loud and steady, providing for yet another dimension of the seriousness of the issue. For readers in the AI world, the book does not require much specific pre-knowledge, where the general public may need a bit more context, aside from the Appendix provided, to understand the reasons for the whole gloom and dusk scenarios. . Quotes . Humans are intelligent to the extent that our actions can be expected to achieve our objectives. . Machines are beneficial to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve our objectives. . References . Russell, S. (2019). Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control.
