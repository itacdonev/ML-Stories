**Score**: 4/5

The research in AI is growing exponentially lately with predictions of even further increase. It seems as if any project somehow sounds and looks better if we add a pinch of AI to it. But does it? Are we driving blindly? Most likely. Some researchers already stoped doing their research because the results and methods are not used in the right way(s). If you want to take the blindfold off, then please read this book.
 
Human Compatible is an honest and eye-opening account of the AI potential, its current shortcomings, and, if we choose the wrong path, our doom. The question is, how do we create an AI system so that we don't need to consider the control issue, or lack of control for that matter, in every scenario of AI application? Russell takes us back in history to revisit the paths taken in human learning, decision making, and actions taken, as well as how we transferred the learning process onto a machine.  As we know, many applications have the AI label from speech recognition, vision systems, translation, etc. and many more will surely come. But our general mission is to develop the so-called general-purpose AI, which by Russell is "...a method that is applicable across all problem types and works effectively for large and difficult instances while making very few assumptions." Sound good, but as he notes in many instances across the book, many precautions need to be taken such as how do we define the objectives of such a system, how do we incorporate our uncertainties (he provides an idea with the simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM method) and irrational decisions?
   
If you want a fresh perspective on what constitutes AI, how to adjust our current practices, or the standard model for an AI, more in line with our uncertain preferences and objectives; then, this book will help you in this quest. Stuart Russell, one of the most prominent persons in the AI world, embarks on the mission to not only examine how and why the AI could go wrong but most importantly what to consider and how to proceed so that we, the humanity, don't end up on the flimsy and half-broken tree branch. 

In many science disciplines, we battle with the question of how our reality will cease to exist. In astronomy, it is in the way of the Sun engulfing the Earth, in biology, it might be some deadly virus that spreads quickly and efficiently, in environmental science it is the climate change, in computer science, it is the AI. Due to the laws of pyhsics, we can't much argue with the Sun engulfing the Earth scenario, but with the AI, we can argue since we are the ones creating the laws. In Human Compatible Russell provides an eye-opening perspective on how to mitigate the AI risk and achieve the human compatible status. The secret lies in how we define the objectives of an AI system.

I enjoyed the book, which makes for a smooth and light read due to the elegant, flowy, and transparent presentation of ideas and concepts despite the complexity of the topic. For readers in the AI world, the book does not require much specific pre-knowledge, where the general public may need a bit more context, aside from the Appendix provided, to understand the reasons for the whole gloom and dusk scenarios.

What makes a robot human-compatible? With many still open questions in the area of neuroscience, we don't know precisely what makes us human since we don't know what consciousness is

It feels as if Russell is on a mission to cautiously guide us towards the path of, as he calls it, human compatible AI.
